_A continuous digital calendar_

While time is continous, many digital calendars aren't. Instead months are usually separated -- just like their paper counterparts. But why should digital calendars do so when technology could provide for a better user experience? 

**Problem:** As units of time (days, weeks, months, years) are often divided into sections in digital calendars, it's difficult to get an overview and grasp of the whole for tasks and events spanning over these sections. 

For example: if an event starts the June 25th and ends July 7th, the user need to switch back and forth between the view of June and July to get a visual overview of the event and it's duration. 

**Solution:** Make a digital calendar that makes use of infinite scrolling and "stitches" units of time together. As the user scrolls more time units are loaded into view. While paper calendars might be limited and can't scale easily, a digital calendar could in theory grow for as long as the user is able to scroll.
